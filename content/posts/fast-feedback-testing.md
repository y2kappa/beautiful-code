Just some random thoughts.

Often playing the `infinite game` is less of a matter of a good strategy and strong faith, but a matter of getting the small, short wins right. It's good to aim far ahead, but sometimes motivation alone won't get you there and a series of intermediate check-ins and rewards can guide you along the way.

Getting the first customer, then the 10th, then the 100th, instead of reaching for the million users. Getting compilation errors instead of null pointer exceptions at runtime.

I believe this makes a lot of difference at the beginning of any process, take learning for example. A framework or library that comes with easy examples to follow, reproduce, straight away copy paste from the documentation and compile is much more likely to be adopted (by me, at least).

Building a docker image with a lot of configurations is no
