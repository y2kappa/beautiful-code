`Perspective is worth 80 IQ points. ` - Alan Kay

Alan Kay [speaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdSD07U5uBs) about the process organisations should go through when building their products. There are many interesting, subtle and some obvious remarks that can send you down rabbit holes and on to new epiphanies.

My top pick is the 3 stage process that he thinks organisations should go through regularly to optimize for both short and long term. In a sense, these 3 steps are different orders of thinking.

Concretely:

- Process A - Building your product. That is the main activity and what you should to best since it brings direct client revenue.
- Process B - Think about how to improve Process A, how do you improve what you should be doing to make it more efficient.
- Process C - Think whether Process A makes sense. Should you even be working on this, should you invest some resources on another pursuit?


Ray Dalio applies this same principle on your own thinking process:

1. What am I thinking about this specific issue?
2. Should I think like that? Should I improve my thinking process.
3. Should I even think about it at all? What should I think about instead?

Shifting perspective can save years of waste.

Interpolating, we can think of our own processes, systems, languages that we use and employ, we can try to resist inertia and save the KTLO cost for doing the same thing you've been doing, apply an initial cost to aim for something strategically better. But this takes effort and some very unpleasant decisions.
