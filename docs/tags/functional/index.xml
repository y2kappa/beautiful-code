      <description>I recently listened to a podcast with Elizabeth Gilbert where she mentioned that sometimes when stumbling upon a well written sentence, it makes her want to stand up an clap at the beauty of it.
I believe the same concept applies to code. Or at least it has happened to me a few times while reading code and being like Ok, that&#39;s beautiful.
I stand by the idea that code is meant to be read, that heuristically code is probably read 10 times more than it is written and therefore we should also optimize for that.</description>
